Here we stand on the edge of time. Time had a beginning when God created it, setting it in motion as an incubator for mankind—those who are most precious to Him. We are now hearing the final ticks of the clock within the dimension of time; soon it will be over, complete, and finished. The last alarm is about to sound. Then, if we have placed our hands in His, we will be snatched up through the bounds of time into the timeless light of God’s presence. The clock will soon be forever silent—no more days to repent, not another second to reach up to our maker, or out to our fellow travelers. We are about to pass through the edge of time into the forever of eternity, never to experience time again and never able to do again what can only be done in this temporary chamber.

“Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last” (Rev 22:12-13 KJV).
