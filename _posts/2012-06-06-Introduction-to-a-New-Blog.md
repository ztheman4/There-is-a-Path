*By Marvin Lynn Cantrell*

I have started a new blog, with a goal to encourage believers. My plan is to post a new blog about twice each month. The blog will be my thoughts on scripture and Christian living. We as Christians need each other. I want to be a blessing to the family of God. I try to make my writing short and to the point.  There will be two or three post in a short time frame to give you a preview of what is to come. Some of my post will be shared on Facebook form time to time. I hope my words will be of help or encouragement to some people. Please post any comments you may have. I hope you will sign up to follow my blog.
