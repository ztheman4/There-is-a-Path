We know what it means to be physically sloppy or messy, but what about a spiritually sloppy life? Are we sloppy with our words, in our habits, in what we see, and what we think?

I would put sloppy words first on the list for a reason—the words we say affect our faith and the faith of others in a much deeper way than we realize.

“Oh,” you say, “my Christian brethren will forgive my sloppy habits; they know this is just me being myself.” Well, maybe a change is needed. Not everybody loves you, and not everybody will understand you.

Are we sloppy about what we view? Everything we let in the eye gate will find a home somewhere in the corridors of our minds. It becomes part of a personal library with anything available to be pulled off the shelves of the mind to influence thoughts and actions.

Indiscriminate thinking will let all sorts of worthless seeds germinate in our minds which will quickly grow into poisonous plants, yielding a deadly crop in our lives.

“Oh, it is OK. God knows I get a little dirty in my walk through this old wicked world,” you say. “God will forgive me.” Yes, He will forgive, but you stunt your spiritual growth and potential as God’s servants with your sloppy ways. Even worse, you may just lose your way all together.

Think of Jesus. Was He ever sloppy?

Lord, forgive me for being sloppy and help me to be the man of character You want me to be.
